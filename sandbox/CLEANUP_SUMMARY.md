# Root Directory Cleanup Summary

Date: 2025-07-21

## What Was Done

Cleaned up the root directory by moving all test scripts, temporary files, and one-time use files into an organized sandbox directory structure.

## Files Moved

### To `sandbox/scripts/`:
- All shell scripts (*.sh) that were in root:
  - `build.sh`
  - `fix_json_tags.py` 
  - `generate-detailed-report.sh`
  - `generate-report.sh`
  - `parse-my-sample.sh`
  - `parse-summary.sh`
  - `run.sh`
  - `run_all_tests.sh`
  - `run_real_tests.sh`
  - `start-catalog.sh`
  - `test.sh`
  - `test_enhanced_extraction.sh`

### To `sandbox/reports/`:
- All HTML report files:
  - Multiple `Ai Text Intro` analysis reports
  - `Layer-01` analysis reports

### To `sandbox/temp/`:
- Backup files:
  - `text_parser_enhanced.go.bak`
  - `text_parser_original.go.bak`

### To `sandbox/tests/`:
- Test files that were in root:
  - `real_data_test.go`

## Result

The root directory is now clean and contains only:
- Core Go source files (item.go, layer.go, project.go, property.go, text_parser.go, util_test.go)
- Essential project files (go.mod, go.sum, LICENSE, README.md)
- Documentation files (ARCHITECTURE.md, COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md, TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- Organized directories for proper project structure

All temporary and development files are preserved in the sandbox directory for reference but clearly marked as not for production use.
