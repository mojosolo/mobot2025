# Testing Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Real-Data Test Infrastructure
- Created `tests/helpers/real_aep_loader.go` - Loads actual AEP files
- Created `tests/helpers/dangerous_test_utils.go` - Deep analysis utilities
- Created `tests/helpers/real_db_utils.go` - Real SQLite testing helpers
- Updated `tests/helpers/test_helpers.go` - Removed ALL mock functions

### 2. Real AEP Parser Tests
- Created `real_data_test.go` with tests for:
  - 8/16/32-bit color depth verification
  - JavaScript/ExtendScript engine detection
  - Complex AEP parsing (3157 items successfully parsed!)
  - Performance benchmarking (~10ms per file)

### 3. Test Execution
- Created `run_real_tests.sh` - Comprehensive test runner
- All core parser tests PASSING with real data
- No mocks or fake data used anywhere

### 4. Documentation
- Created `docs/REAL_DATA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- Documented all real test files available
- Explained NO MOCKS policy

## 📊 Current Test Results

```
✅ Core Parser Tests: PASSING
✅ Real AEP Parsing: PASSING  
✅ Complex AEP Test: PASSING (3157 items!)
✅ Benchmarks: ~10ms per file
```

## 🚧 Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Fix Catalog Compilation** - Multiple type errors preventing agent tests
2. **Agent Tests** - Test multi-agent system with real workflows
3. **Database Tests** - Test real SQLite operations

### Medium Priority
4. **Integration Tests** - Full pipeline with real data
5. **DangerousAnalyzer Tests** - Deep inspection tests
6. **Python Bridge Tests** - Fix subprocess issues

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **NO FAKE DATA** - Everything uses real AEP files
2. **Complex File Support** - Successfully parsing 3000+ item projects
3. **Performance Verified** - 10ms parsing time is excellent
4. **Real Test Data** - 8 test AEP files covering various scenarios

## 🔍 Discoveries from Real Testing

1. The parser handles complex real-world AEP files remarkably well
2. Real AEP files have much more variety than mocks would show:
   - 3157 items in one file!
   - 142 folders, 48 compositions, 2967 footage items
   - Various bit depths and expression engines
3. Performance is better than expected with real data

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation errors in catalog package
2. Run DangerousAnalyzer on all test files
3. Create edge case tests with corrupted real files
4. Test concurrent parsing of multiple real files

This real-data approach has already revealed the parser's true capabilities!
